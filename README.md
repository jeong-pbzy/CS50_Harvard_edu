# CS50_Harvard_edu   
## Intro.  
I take the class "CS50" from edwith boostcourse.  
I choose this course for 3 reasons.  
*  Understand the basic concepts of computer science.  
* I can Practice array, data structure, and algorithms using C.  
* Develops the computing thinking required for programming.

### Week1. Computational Thinking   
#### 1) Binary, bit, byte   
Q. What is 5 in binary?   
A. 101   
(2^2*1)+(2^1*0)+(2^0*1)=4+0+1=5   
#### 2) ASCII, Unicode, RGB   
Q. What is "CS50" in binary?   
A. 01000011  01010011  00110010     
C(67) : 1000011   
S(83) : 1010011   
50 : 110010   
#### 3) Algorithms, Pseudocode
This is Pseudocode.

    1 Pick up phone book
    2 Open to middle of phone book
    3 Look at page
    4 If Smith is on page
    5	call Mike
    6 Else if Smith is earlier in book
    7	Open to middle of left half of book
    8	Go back to line 3
    9 Else if smith is later in book
    10	Open to middle of right half of book
    11	Go back to line 3
    12 Else
    13	Quit
